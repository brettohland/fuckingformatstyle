# A Bit Of Documentation

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Hugo Geekdocs](https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc) template.

Hugo/Chroma's syntax highlighting for Swift isn't great, so there's a post-processing step that's used to add syntax highlighting using [SplashMarkdown](https://github.com/xyproto/splash) during deployment.

# Where's The Content?
